              Email remains a critical tool for both professional and personal communication, with the average worker spending approximately 28% of their workday managing their inbox. Despite significant technological advancements, the core functionality of email platforms has seen limited evolution over the years. Recent progress in AI language models presents a unique opportunity to transform how users engage with email, potentially saving hours of work each week while improving the quality of communication. GoFloww aims to harness these advancements to introduce intelligent, context-aware capabilities within the Atom Mail platform, enhancing user experience and communication efficiency.

              Design and implement an AI-driven solution for GoFloww's Atom Mail platform to enable smart email composition, response generation, and content refinement based on user prompts.

              Key challenges to address include ensuring user privacy, delivering a seamless user experience, maintaining the accuracy of AI-generated content, and handling diverse email contexts (formal, informal, technical, etc.).
